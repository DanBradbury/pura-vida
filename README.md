# Pura Vida
Just the good life. Turn your new mac into a fully-configured modern development machine by running a single command.

## Inspiration
Things like [omakub.org](https://omakub.org/) and other 1-line installers ([install.sh](https://github.com/donnybrilliant/install.sh), etc) are pretty attractive in their own regards and I would recommend either if the description fits your bill.

The aim of the `pura-vida` setup is to remove the headache and initial tool indecision out of the mix and provide a set of tools to get you working effectively as soon as possible. This project is not for folks who already have their dotfiles fully-baked + copy-pasta already established for new machine setup.

## What's in the setup
- iterm2
- ohmyzsh
- lazygit
- vim + macvim
- Nerd Fonts (Cascadia Mono)
- GitHub CLI: `gh` command
- Docker
- mise to manage Ruby/Node.js/Python/Go/etc
